1.Write a program that inputs an integer that represents a length of time in seconds.  
The program should then output the number of hours, minutes, and seconds that corresponds to that number of seconds.  
For example, if the user inputs 50391 total seconds then the program should output 13 hours, 59 minutes, and 51 seconds.  

// Programming Project 1.11
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "Enter a time in seconds." << endl;
	int s;
	cin >> s;

	int hours, minutes, seconds;
	hours = s / 3600;
	minutes = (s % 3600) / 60;
	seconds = (s % 3600) % 60;

	cout << s << " total seconds is equivalent to " <<
		hours << " hours, " << minutes <<
		" minutes, and " << seconds <<
		" seconds. "<< endl;

}

2. Write a program that calculates how much a deposit of a certain amount of dollars will grow in a year,when the rate of grow is 6.9% annualy.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	const double RATE = 6.9 ;
	double deposit ;
	cout << " Enter the amount of your deposit in $ ";
	cin  >> deposit;
	
	double newBalance;
	newBalance = deposit + deposit * (RATE/100);
	cout << "In one year,the deposit of " << deposit << " $"
	     << " will grow to " << newBalance << " $";
}

3.Ideal Body Weight Estimation
A simple rule to estimate your ideal body weight is to allow 110 pounds for the first 5 feet of height and 5 pounds for each additional inch.  
Write a program with a variable for the height of a person in feet and another variable for the additional inches and input values for these variables from the keyboard.   
Assume the person is at least 5 feet tall.  
For example, a person that is 6 feet and 3 inches tall would be represented with a variable that stores the number 6 and another variable that stores the number 3.
Based on these values calculate and output the ideal body weight.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
        int heightFeet = 5;
        int heightInches = 5;
        cout << "Your ideal body weight is ";
        int weight = 110 + ((heightFeet - 5)*12 + heightInches) * 5;
        cout << weight << " pounds." << endl;

        return 0;
}
4.Lethal Caffeine
Scientists estimate that consuming roughly 10 grams of caffeine at once is a lethal overdose. 
Write a program that inputs the number of milligrams of caffeine in a drink and outputs how many drinks it would take to kill a person. 
A 12 ounce can of cola has approximately 34 mg of caffeine while a 16 ounce cup of coffee has approximately 160 mg of caffeine.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int mg;

  cout << "How many milligrams of caffeine in the drink?" << endl;
  cin >> mg;

  // 10 grams to kill a person is 10000 mg
  int numDrinks = 10000 / mg;
  cout << "The number of drinks it will take to kill someone is " <<
       numDrinks << " drinks." << endl;

  return 0;
}

5.Write a program that allows the user to enter a time in seconds and then outputs how far an object would drop if it is in freefall for that length of time.  
Assume no friction or resistance from air and a constant acceleration of 32 feet per second due to gravity.( You can rewrite the program to use m/s ). 
the equation: distance = 1/2 * acceleration * time * time
	 
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "Enter a time in seconds." << endl;
	int s;
	cin >> s;

	int distance;
	distance = (32 / 2) * (s * s);

	cout << "An object in freefall for " << s << 
		" seconds will fall " << distance <<
		" feet." << endl;
}


6.Enter an integer number from the keyboard.
Print a message indicating if the number is odd or even.

#include <iostream> // allows program to perform input and output
using namespace std; // program uses names from the std namespace

int main()
{
   int number; // integer read from user

   cout << "Enter an integer: "; // prompt
   cin >> number; // read integer from user

   if ( number % 2 == 0 )
      cout << "The integer " << number << " is even." << endl;

   if ( number % 2 != 0 )
      cout << "The integer " << number << " is odd." << endl;
} // end main
