1. Write a program that uses a forstatement to sum a sequence of integers.
Assume that the first integer specifies the number of values remaining to be 
entered. Your program should read only one value per input statement.
A typical input sequence might be:
5  100   200   300  400  500
where 5 indicates that the subsequent 5 values are to be summed.

2.Write a program that uses a for statement to calculate the average of several
integers. assume the last value read is the sentinel 9999. A typical sequence might be:
  10  8  11 7  9  9999
indicating that the program should calculate the average of all values preceding 9999.

3. Write a program that uses a for statement to find the smallest of several integers. 
Assume that the first value read specifies the number of values remaining.

4. Write a program that uses a for statement to calculate and print the product of odd 
integers from 1 to 15.

5. Write a program that uses for statements to print the following pattern.
All asterisks should be printed by a single statement cout << '*';
a)

6. One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts. 
Write a program that reads 5 numbers ( each between 1 and 30). Assume that the user
enters only valid values. For each number that's read, your program should print a line 
containing that number of adjacent asterisks. 

7.A mail order house sells five different products whose retail prices are: product 1- $2.98,
product 2 - $4.50, product 3 - $9.98, product 4 - $4.49 and product 5 - $6.87.
Write a program that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
a) product number
b) quantity sold
Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product.
Your program should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold.
Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the results.

8. Calculate the value of pi from the infinite series:
pi= 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 +... with a given accuracy.

9. A right triangle can have sides that are all integers. A set of three integer values for the sides
of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean triple. These three sides must satisfy the relationship
that the sum of the squares of two sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Find all Pythagorean 
triples for side1, side2 and hypothenuse all no larger than 500. Use a triple-nested for loop that tries 
all possibilities.This is an example of brute force computing.You'll learn in more advanced computer science 
course that there are many interesting problems for which there is no known algorithmic approach other than 
sheer brute force.

10.Challenge
In cryptarithmetic puzzles, mathematical equations are written using letters.  
Each letter can be a digit from 0 to 9, but no two letters can be the same.   
Here is a sample problem:

SEND + MORE = MONEY

A solution to the puzzle is S = 9, R = 8, O = 0, M = 1, Y = 2, E = 5, N = 6, D = 7
Write a program that finds solutions to the cryptarithmetic puzzle of:

TOO + TOO + TOO + TOO = GOOD

The simplest technique is to use a nested loop for each unique letter (in this case T, O, G, D). 
The loops would systematically assign the digits from 0-9 to each letter.   
For example, it might first try T = 0, O = 0, G = 0, D = 0, then T = 0, O = 0, G =0, D = 1, then T = 0, O = 0, G = 0, D = 2, etc.
up to T = 9, O = 9, G = 9, D = 9.  In the loop body test that each variable is unique and that the equation is satisfied.  
Output the values for the letters that satisfy the equation.
