Real Time Kernals offer:

1- Low Latency
2- Deterministic (Behaves in a way we understand wheras modern os are confusing)
3- Predictable Response Times 

Real time kernals can prioritize tasks from range 0-99 (99 highest priority)

Premption/Premtable meaning: If tasks are running in a queue with lower priorities.
			     Premption allows for higher priority tasks to execute
			     while interupting the current tasks before returning back
			     to complete the previous tasks


Realtime kernal Types:

1- Hard Realtime Kernal --> Strict Deadlines, Errors and tasks must be completed within tight times. 
(EX:flight control, cruise control, Medical Devices, Defense Systems)
2- Soft Realtime Kernal --> Allows more leeway, System will not crash if schedule tasks are not completed within deadlines
(EX: Pcs, CD/DVD, Most Operating Systems)
