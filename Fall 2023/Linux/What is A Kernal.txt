A kernal is a program that serves to communicate with the hardware (cpu, gpu, ect..). 
Linux is a kernal. Kernals can do many things:
1- Reading and writing out input and output devices
2- CPU tasks, translates instrucitons for it
3-Schdules Tasks to prevent erros
4- Memory Allocation and Deallocation
5- Built in Security, prevents programs from being crossed together
and much more for other devices

There are types of kernals, 
1- Monolithic kernal (very fast but at the cost of having strict scheduling so it risks crashes)
2- Microkernal (opposite of a monolithic)
3- Exokernal
4- Nanokernal
5- Hybrid Kernal (Mix of 1 & 2)

Linux Kernal --> Monolithic

Windows --> NT Kernal
Apple OS --> XNU (X not unix)
