//How to use predefined functions.
//This program uses the math functions pow and sqrt to determine
//and output the volume of a sphere, the distance between two 
//points, respectively, and the string function length to find 
//the number of characters in a string.
//If the radius of the sphere is r, then the volume of the sphere
//is (4/3)*PI*r^3. If (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the coordinates of two 
//points in the XY-plane, then the distance between these points is 
//sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2).

Problem

One way to estimate the height of a child is to use the following formula, which uses the height of the parents:

		Hmale_child = ((Hmother * 13 / 12) + Hfather)/2
		Hfemale_child = ((Hfather * 12 / 13) + Hmother)/2

All heights are in inches.Write a program that takes as input parameters the gender of the child, height of the mother in inches, 
and height of the father in inches, and outputs the estimated height of the child in inches.   
The user should be able to input the heights in feet and inches, and the program should output the estimated height of the child 
in feet and inches.Use the integer data type to store the heights.
