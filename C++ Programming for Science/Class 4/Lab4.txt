1.Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers,
obtains the numbers from the user, then prints the larger 
number followed by the words " is larger". If the numbers 
are equal, print the message " These numbers are equal".

#include <iostream> // allows program to perform input and output
using namespace std; // program uses names from the std namespace

int main()
{
   int number1{0}; // first integer read from user
   int number2{0}; // second integer read from user

   cout << "Enter two integers: "; // prompt user for data
   cin >> number1 >> number2; // read two integers from user

   if (number1 == number2) {
      cout << "These numbers are equal." << endl;
   }

   if (number1 > number2) {
      cout << number1 << " is larger." << endl;
   }

   if (number2 > number1) {
      cout << number2 << " is larger." << endl;
   }
} 

2. Write a program that inputs three integers from the keyboard and prints the 
sum, average, product,smallest and largest of these numbers.The screen dialog
should appear as follows:

Input three different integers ; 13  27  14
Sum is 54
Average is 18
Product is 4914
Smallest is 13
Largest is 27


#include <iostream> // allows program to perform input and output
using namespace std; // program uses names from the std namespace

int main()
{
   int number1{0}; // first integer read from user
   int number2{0}; // second integer read from user
   int number3{0}; // third integer read from user
   int smallest{0}; // smallest integer read from user
   int largest{0}; // largest integer read from user

   cout << "Input three different integers: "; // prompt
   cin >> number1 >> number2 >> number3; // read three integers

   largest = number1; // assume first integer is largest

   if (number2 > largest) { // is number2 larger?
      largest = number2; // number2 is now the largest
   }

   if (number3 > largest) { // is number3 larger?
      largest = number3; // number3 is now the largest
   }

   smallest = number1; // assume first integer is smallest

   if (number2 < smallest) { // is number2 smaller?
      smallest = number2; // number2 is now the smallest
   }

   if (number3 < smallest) { // is number3 smaller?
      smallest = number3; // number3 is now the smallest
   }

   cout << "Sum is " << number1 + number2 + number3 
      << "\nAverage is " << (number1 + number2 + number3) / 3 
      << "\nProduct is " << number1 * number2 * number3 
      << "\nSmallest is " << smallest 
      << "\nLargest is " << largest << endl;
} 

3.An employee is paid with a rate of 16.78 $ per hour if he works less or equal 
than 40 hours per week.For the hours that he is working overtime he is paid 50% more.
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of hours worked in a week and 
calculates the salary that the employee will be paid.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

	const double RATE{ 16.78 };
	int hours;
	double pay;
	cout << " How many hours you worked this week ? ";
	cin >> hours;

	if (hours <= 40)
		pay = RATE * hours;

	if (hours > 40)
		pay = RATE * 40 + RATE * (hours - 40) * 1.5;

	
	cout << "\nThe salary is : " << pay << endl;
	return 0;
}


Since the number of hours can be only larger or smaller than 40 we can write our program as follows:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{

	const double RATE{ 16.78 };
	int hours;
	double pay;
	cout << " How many hours you worked this week ? ";
	cin >> hours;

	if (hours <= 40)
		pay = RATE * hours;

	else
		pay = RATE * 40 + RATE * (hours - 40) * 1.5;

	
	cout << "\nThe salary is : " << pay << endl;
	return 0;
}


4. Write a program that prompts the user to enter five test scores and then prints the average test score.
Assume that the test scores are decimal numbers.

5.Write a program that does the following:
a)Prompts the user to input five decimal numbers.
b)Prints the five decimal numbers.
c)Converts each decimal number to the nearest integer.
d)Adds the five integers.
e)Prints the sum and the average of the five integers.

5. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the capacity, in gallons, of an automobile fuel tank and
the miles per gallons the automobile can be driven.The program outputs the number of miles the automobile
can be driven without refueling.

6.Write a program that prompts the user to input a length expressed in centimeters.The program should then convert
the length to inches ( to the nearest inch )and output the length expressed in yards, feet and inches, in this order.
For example, suppose the input for centimeters is 312. To the nearest inch, 312 centimeters is equal to 123 inches.
123 inches would thus be output as:
3 yard(s), 1 feet (foot), and 3 inch(es).

7.You found an exciting summer job for five weeks.It pays, say, 15.50$ per hour.Suppose that the total tax you pay on your summer
job income is 14%. After paying the taxes, you spend 10% of your net income to buy new clothes and other accessories for the next 
school year and 1% to buy school supplies.After buying clothes and school supplies, you use 25% of the remaining money to buy 
savings bonds.For each dollar you spend to buy savings bonds, your parents spend $0.50 to buy additional savings bonds for you.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the pay rate for an hour and the number of hours you worked each week.
The program then outputs the following:
a. Your income before and after taxes from your summer job.
b. The money you spend on clothes and other accessories.
c. The money you spend on school supplies.
d. The money you spend to buy savings bonds.
e. The money your parents spend to buy additional savings bonds for you.
